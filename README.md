# DPsaves
Makes copy of Deadly Premonition save in regular intervals with timestamp.

# What you need:
Python 3.x - https://www.python.org/downloads/

# Setup
Open Dpsaves.py in any text editor, Notepad is enough.

Set src and dst paths as written in file. There are examples there, By default the backup folder is "C:\bckup\dp\".

Remember to make the backup folder beforehand.

# How to use
Set pythonw.exe as default program for .py files to run it in the background with double-click, or use "Open with" and choose pythonw.exe (python with white window in icon).

Before running Deadly Premonition, run DPsaves.py.

Check your backup folder to see if a copy of the save was made.

To turn off, kill python in task manager.

# Other information

This program should not be using many resources, only about 17MB of RAM.

Don't mind the print commands, these are for console debugging.

Remember to remove the timestamp before restoring any save - change name to "dp.sav".

Probably does not make DP crash, hard to tell because the damn game crashes anyway all the time.

Works on my machine, Zach.
